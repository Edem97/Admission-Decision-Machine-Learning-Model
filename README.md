# Admission-Decision-Machine-Learning-Model
This is a simple machine learning logistic regression model to predict whether a student should be considered for admission based on his/her test performance.
# Problem Statement

Suppose that I am the administrator of a university department and I want to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams.

I have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression.
For each training example, I  have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions decision.
I built a classification model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based on the scores from those two exams.
